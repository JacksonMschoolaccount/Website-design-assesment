            Te Puia is located in the Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal Valley in Rotorua and is 70 hectares in size. Here we have world renowned mud pools, hot springs, and more. We also have the national schools of wood, stone, and bone carving, also weaving. Te Puia is also home to the native kiwi bird. The values of manaakitanga and kaitiakitanga (hopitality and guardianship) are our top priority. We strive to treat every visitor with respect and protect the natural taonga (tresures) within Te Puia. We have shared our culture and our taonga with visitors for over 170 years and plan to keep doing so for generations to come.
